Section 2.
  As we change the absorption parameter to zero, the sphere becomes brighter gradually. This is because the medium absorbs less light along the way.

Section 3.
  For sigma_s, as the value increases, the image becomes dimmer because the scattering effect is more significant.
  For sigma_a, as the value increases, the image becomes darker because more light gets absorbed.

Section 4.
  For sigma_s, as the value increases, the image becomes dimmer because the scattering effect is more significant.
  For sigma_a, as the value increases, the image becomes darker because more light gets absorbed.
  For max_depth, we notice that the sphere with medium_1 becomes darker if we decrease the max_depth. This is caused by fewer rays hitting the light source since light paths are now shorter.

Section 5.
  This object is similar to a Lambertian object. They are alike because the absorption rate of the object is high (dense volume) so a lot of light attenuation happened, causing the object to look like a Lambertian object.

Section 6.
  As we increase the index of refraction, we see a decrease in the brightness of the image. A large IOR causes a lot of internal reflections and therefore fewer light rays that carry the energy of the inner sphere are able to propagate out.
